Passes in LLVM Passes should be added to LLVM project. It can be done simply by puting the pass code inside llvm/lib and updating the CMake in llvm/lib. Afterward, llvm should be rebuilded. Then, llvm directory and test cases directory should be passed to run.sh.

The result will be available under test_dir/log/filename_AnalysisResults.log

I created several simple test cases to check the functionallity of passes, and the ranker algorithm.
The code is in the begining phase of development and functions and models are subject to change.
